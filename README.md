# Pet Food Prices Webscraper
## General Information
This is a webscraper to compare pet food prices between the different stores I usually buy from. I am using this so I can find the best price at time of purchase. Currently it will only cover Remy's dog food brand, but will eventually become sophisticated enough to compare price per pound or ounce as well as include the cat's food.

## Programs and Packages Needed:
Python 3\
selenium: `pip install selenium`\
geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 

## Changes You May Need to Make:
you will need to add geckodriver to your path in the script under the variable `gecko_path`, so make sure to update the path from the one on my computer to lead to where you have geckodriver on your computer.
